The fall session of our Online Academy kicked off in October, an 8 week self-serve course designed to teach people how to make their own iPhone game. Itâ€™s a mix of text-and-image based online tutorials, peer-to-peer support and paid technical support, provided by our new partner Codementor. Enrollment rose more than 15x from the summer session creating an active online learning community around the course.
